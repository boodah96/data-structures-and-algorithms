# Hashtables
 A Hashtable uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found
## Challenge
create Hashtable class with basic methods
## Approach & Efficiency
HashTable class contain a hash function to create an index after that adding value with the key in giving bucket and return value depends on key.
with Big O:
- time:O(1)
- space:O(1) 
## API
- `add`: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- `get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- `contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- `hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
