# Stacks and Queues
create stack and Queue classes

## Challenge
how to apply the approach of stack and Queue
## Approach & Efficiency
- Big O
 - Time : O(n)
 - space : O(n)

- ## API
 - push:  takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack class.
 - pop :takes off the top value of the stack class, 
 - dequeue:  removes the node from the top of the class, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.

 - enqueue: takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the stack class.
 - peek: returns the value of the node located in the front of Queue/top of the Stack without Changing
 - isEmpty: returns a boolean indicating whether or not the class is empty
