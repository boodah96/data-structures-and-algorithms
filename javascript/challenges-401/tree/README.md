# Trees
A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child

## Challenge
- Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## API


- preOrder: Root - Left - Right. 
- inOrder : left - Root - Right. 
- postOrder: Root - Left - Right. 
- add method: add a value to the tree
- contains method: return true if the tree contain the value.
