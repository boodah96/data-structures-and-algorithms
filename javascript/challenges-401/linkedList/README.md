# Singly Linked List
Singly linked list: the collection of ordered set of elements. The number of elements may vary according to need of the program. A node in the singly linked list consist of two parts: data part and link part. Data part of the node stores actual information that is to be represented by the node while the link part of the node stores the address of its immediate successor.
## Challenge
how to create the function satisfy the requirement for LinkedList class as includes.
## Approach & Efficiency
create to classes NOde and linkedList and in LinkesdList class we have a constructor ad three functions (isersts, includes, toString)
and each function do specific approach 
#### Big O
- time: O(n)
- space: O(n)
## API
- insert() : function add a new nodes into the head of linked list.
- includes(value): function check if have the value in the linked list.
-  toString(): function will print all the values inside the linked list
